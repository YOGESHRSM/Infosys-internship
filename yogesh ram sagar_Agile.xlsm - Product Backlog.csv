S1,S1,US1,"Overview: This AI-based Aadhaar fraud detection project automates the identification of fake or tampered Aadhaar cards using OCR and AI. It ensures security, detects anomalies, and prevents misuse of Aadhaar-linked services. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, classification, detection, fraud scoring, and deploying a user-friendly interface for real-time verification.",MUST HAVE,NO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S2,S2,US2,"Workflow: This project detects Aadhaar fraud by implementing a structured workflow. Steps include: Data cleaning to preprocess images, Classification of Aadhaar vs Non-Aadhaar images, Data detection for tampered regions,OCR for text extraction, Matching scoring logic to verify authenticity, and integration of a responsive frontend with backend for seamless operation.",SHOULD HAVE,NO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S3,S3,US3,"Document Usecase: This project ensures Aadhaar authenticity, combating fraud in government schemes, banking, and identity verification. It prevents misuse of Aadhaar-linked services, detects tampered or fake IDs, and streamlines verification processes. By automating fraud detection with AI and OCR, it enhances security, reduces manual errors, and builds trust in digital identity systems.",SHOULD HAVE,NO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S4,S4,US4,"Dataset Selection: We chose the dataset for its diverse Aadhaar and non-Aadhaar images, enabling robust classification, detection, and fraud prevention.",MUST HAVE,Yes,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S5,S5,US5,"Model Selection: We used YOLOv11 for its speed, accuracy, and real-time object detection capabilities, making it ideal for detecting Aadhaar tampering.",SHOULD HAVE,Yes,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S6,S6,US6,"Classification Model: We performed data classification to distinguish between Aadhaar and non-Aadhaar images, ensuring the system accurately processes only valid Aadhaar cards for fraud detection tasks.",MUST HAVE,YOLO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S7,S7,US7,"Detection Model: We used detection to identify specific features or tampered regions on Aadhaar cards, such as altered text or photos, ensuring precise fraud identification and enhanced security.",MUST HAVE,YOLO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S8,S8,US8,"OCR: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used in AI-based Aadhar fraud detection to extract text from images or documents, enabling automated analysis and comparison for fraud identification.",MUST HAVE,YOLO,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S9,S9,US9,"Frontend and Backend: In the AI-based Aadhar fraud detection system, the frontend uses HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic features. The backend is powered by Flask (Python), SQLite for database storage, and JSON for data handling.",SHOULD HAVE,"Python, HTML",Mentor- 521,3- Completed
S10,S10,US10,"Integration: We integrated Flask with SQLite for database handling, used JSON for data exchange, and connected the frontend (HTML, Bootstrap) with backend APIs for dynamic functionality.",SHOULD HAVE,Python,Mentor- 521,3- Completed
